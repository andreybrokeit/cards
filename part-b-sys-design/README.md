# Cards: System Design

Based on the first assignment, please be prepared to describe how to create a web-based server version that would:
- Allow from _two to five_ people to play the beginnings of a five-card poker game together
- Allow multiple games to be played _simultaneously_, each with a different set of up to five
people
- Each game would deal five cards to the players participating in the same game
- The server would keep track of and coordinate the player selection, play behavior, games, cards, results etc

Note this is not an assignment to actually build a web-based poker system.

Instead, we are asking you to consider and explore team, system and architectural design concerns involved in building a full-fledged system.

Example concerns: team composition, build and testing processes, storage, schema design, data layers, service layers, web frameworks (streaming? Traditional request response?), etc
